For steps 2 and beyond, you can install libraries and dependencies in either **Visual Studio Code’s terminal** or your computer’s **PowerShell** (or Terminal on macOS/Linux). However, using **Visual Studio Code’s integrated terminal** can be more convenient since you’ll have everything in one place while you’re coding. Here’s how to proceed with each step:

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### **Step 2: Install Core Libraries and Frameworks**

1. **Open Visual Studio Code** and navigate to the project folder where you plan to build the bot.
   
2. **Open the Integrated Terminal** in Visual Studio Code by going to:
   - Menu: **View > Terminal** or pressing the shortcut `Ctrl + `` (backtick)` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd + `` (backtick)` on macOS.
   
3. **Install Python Libraries**:
   - In the terminal, run the following command to install essential Python libraries.
   - If you’re using a virtual environment, make sure it’s activated before running these commands:
     ```bash
     pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn xgboost lightgbm tensorflow ta-lib requests alpha_vantage finnhub-python sqlalchemy plotly python-telegram-bot
     ```

4. **Install Node.js and Frontend Libraries**:
   - Ensure **Node.js** and **npm** are installed on your system. You can check by running:
     ```bash
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```
   - If they’re not installed, download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
   - Next, create a Next.js app (if you haven’t already):
     ```bash
     npx create-next-app trading-bot-dashboard
     cd trading-bot-dashboard
     ```
   - Install frontend libraries in the Next.js project directory:
     ```bash
     npm install react-plotly.js plotly.js styled-components
     ```

#### **Step 3: Set Up Database and Cache**

1. **PostgreSQL Installation**:
   - Install PostgreSQL by downloading it from [PostgreSQL’s website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
   - After installation, create a new database for your project.
   - You can also install a PostgreSQL GUI tool like **pgAdmin** or **DBeaver** for easier database management.

2. **Redis Installation** (optional for caching):
   - Install Redis locally by downloading it from [Redis Labs](https://redis.io/download).
   - Alternatively, you can use a managed Redis service like **Redis Labs Cloud** if you prefer not to set it up locally.

#### **Step 4: Backend API and WebSocket Setup**

1. **Create a Flask or FastAPI Backend**:
   - Use VS Code’s terminal to install Flask or FastAPI if you haven’t already:
     ```bash
     pip install flask flask-socketio
     ```
   - Start coding your backend API in **VS Code** within your project folder.

2. **Run Your Backend Locally**:
   - In VS Code, you can start the Flask/FastAPI server by running:
     ```bash
     flask run
     ```
   - Use `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (or similar) to access your local API during testing.

---

#### **Step 5: Connect Backend with Frontend**

1. **API Calls in Next.js**:
   - In the Next.js project directory, set up API routes or direct fetch requests to your Flask/FastAPI backend.

2. **WebSocket Setup**:
   - You can use **Socket.IO** in both your Flask backend and Next.js frontend to enable real-time data updates.

---

#### **Step 6: Deploy the Application**

1. **Install Docker**:
   - Download Docker from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and install it on your machine.
   - Once Docker is installed, you can create Dockerfiles for your frontend and backend applications, making them ready for deployment.

2. **Deployment**:
   - Use **AWS EC2**, **Google Cloud Compute**, or similar services to deploy your Dockerized app.
   - You can continue managing deployment via the terminal in VS Code or use a cloud provider’s web interface.

By following these steps in **Visual Studio Code’s integrated terminal**, you can streamline development and testing. However, if you prefer, you can also run these commands in **PowerShell** or your OS’s native terminal. Just ensure you navigate to your project’s directory before running each command.
