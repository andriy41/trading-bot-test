Now that the environment is set up, here’s a roadmap for building and testing each component of the trading bot, along with some best practices for integration and deployment. We'll follow a modular approach to ensure that each part functions independently before bringing everything together.

### Development Roadmap

#### 1. **Develop and Test the Data Collection Module**
   - **Objective**: Set up real-time data collection and API rate-limiting with Alpha Vantage and Finnhub.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Write functions to pull live and historical data from both APIs.
     - Implement a switching mechanism so the bot switches from Alpha Vantage to Finnhub when rate limits are reached.
   - **Testing**:
     - Confirm that data is pulled correctly from both sources.
     - Test switching between APIs when hitting rate limits.
   - **Save Data**: Store collected data in your database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for model training and backtesting.

#### 2. **Implement Data Preprocessing and Quality Checks**
   - **Objective**: Ensure clean and consistent data across different timeframes.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Develop functions to normalize, clean, and handle missing data.
     - Synchronize data from multiple timeframes (1ms, 5 mins, etc.) to ensure they are aligned.
   - **Testing**:
     - Test with real data samples to verify normalization and consistency.
     - Ensure all data is ready for model training, backtesting, and real-time usage.

#### 3. **Build the Technical Indicators Module**
   - **Objective**: Calculate core indicators like SMA, EMA, MACD, and others.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Use TA-Lib or your custom calculations to implement each indicator.
     - Store results for each indicator in your database or cache for easy access.
   - **Testing**:
     - Verify the accuracy of each indicator using known values.
     - Check consistency across different timeframes.

#### 4. **Develop and Train the Machine Learning Models**
   - **Objective**: Create models to predict price movements based on historical data.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Train individual models like XGBoost, LSTM, and Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT).
     - Combine model predictions in an ensemble to increase accuracy.
     - Tune hyperparameters using Grid Search or Bayesian Optimization.
   - **Testing**:
     - Use backtesting on historical data to evaluate model performance.
     - Track key metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

#### 5. **Set Up Signal Generation and Filtering**
   - **Objective**: Generate and filter buy/sell signals based on the bot’s confidence threshold (85%).
   - **Tasks**:
     - Develop the logic to generate signals based on indicators, model predictions, and timeframes.
     - Implement a confidence filter that only allows high-probability trades to pass through.
     - Add stop-loss and take-profit calculations to manage risk.
   - **Testing**:
     - Backtest signal generation with historical data.
     - Review sample trades to verify that only high-confidence signals are being executed.

#### 6. **Integrate the Execution Layer**
   - **Objective**: Connect to a brokerage API (e.g., Interactive Brokers or Alpaca) to enable live trading.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Implement buy/sell order functions.
     - Test order modification and cancellation for flexibility during live trading.
   - **Testing**:
     - Use a paper trading account (sandbox environment) to simulate trades without risking capital.
     - Track order response times and ensure they meet your latency requirements.

#### 7. **Build the Frontend Dashboard in Next.js**
   - **Objective**: Create a responsive dashboard to display trading signals, performance metrics, and interactive charts.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Set up Next.js with pages for the main dashboard, settings, and analytics.
     - Integrate Plotly.js or D3.js to create interactive charts showing price trends, indicators, and signals.
     - Connect the frontend to your backend API and WebSocket for real-time data updates.
   - **Testing**:
     - Check data loading times and interactive features.
     - Verify that charts and indicators are displayed correctly and update in real-time.

#### 8. **Implement Telegram Notifications for Real-Time Alerts**
   - **Objective**: Send buy/sell signals and updates to a Telegram group.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Write functions to send messages using the `python-telegram-bot` library.
     - Format messages to include relevant trade details (e.g., ticker, signal type, confidence, stop-loss, take-profit).
   - **Testing**:
     - Test by sending notifications in response to sample trade signals.
     - Verify that all necessary information is included and formatted clearly.

#### 9. **Add Logging, Monitoring, and Error Handling**
   - **Objective**: Track bot activity, errors, and performance.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Set up logging to track API requests, trades, and errors.
     - Implement monitoring tools to track server performance and latency.
     - Add automated error handling for issues like rate limits, API failures, and network interruptions.
   - **Testing**:
     - Simulate common errors (e.g., API limit reached, network down) to verify that they’re handled gracefully.
     - Monitor logs for accuracy and completeness.

### Testing and Deployment

#### 1. **Comprehensive Backtesting**
   - Run backtests across multiple timeframes and assets to validate the bot’s logic, model accuracy, and signal generation.
   - Log the results and analyze metrics like profit/loss, accuracy, drawdown, and Sharpe ratio.

#### 2. **Paper Trading**
   - Set up a sandbox or paper trading account with your brokerage API to simulate live trading without financial risk.
   - Let the bot run in a controlled environment, watching for any inconsistencies or issues in order execution.

#### 3. **Deploy the Bot**
   - **Containerization**: Use Docker to containerize your Python backend and Next.js frontend, making deployment easier and more consistent.
   - **Cloud Deployment**: Deploy your bot on AWS EC2, Google Cloud, or a similar service. For low-latency trading, choose a server close to your brokerage’s data center.
   - **NGINX**: Set up NGINX as a reverse proxy to efficiently manage requests between the frontend and backend.

#### 4. **Monitoring and Maintenance**
   - Regularly monitor the bot’s performance, tracking metrics like latency, success rates, and any error occurrences.
   - Schedule model retraining or parameter adjustments as the bot’s performance data accumulates.

### Summary

This roadmap covers all critical stages, from data collection and preprocessing to live trading, dashboard visualization, and deployment. Each step includes specific tasks, testing strategies, and tools, ensuring a modular development approach for easy debugging and optimization. Once you complete these stages, your bot will be well-equipped to handle real-time market data, predict trends accurately, and execute trades efficiently.
